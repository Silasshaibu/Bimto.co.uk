    <h3>
        Who we are
    </h3>

    <p>
        We have made it our mission to share the work of entrepreneurial, creative makers and artists with those who love things that are unique, functional and inspiring.
    </p>

    <p>
        So often when trying to buy something unique, the market is flooded with things which look the same. This is our opportunity to give you gifts, solutions and ideas you hadn’t even thought of.
    </p>

    <p>
        Enjoy the experience of shopping in a different way and buying something unique and personal, a brilliant idea made to order.
    </p>

    <p>
        We work with a number of different maker/sellers and wherever possible make sure their products are environmentally friendly and, if appropriate to do so, locally sourced. However, we do recommend buyers also carry out their own due diligence to ensure the products is as sustainable as it can be. We are continuing to improve our record on sustainability and any feedback is gratefully received.
    </p>

    <h3>
        What we do
    </h3>

    We work with artists, inventors, designers and makers to bring their brilliant products to market.

    <p>
        As a seller with a subscription you will be able to upload your photos, write the descriptions and set your own prices. You will communicate directly with your buyer and receive all the money paid (no additional fees taken by us, only transaction fees are debited from your total by the card payment gateway STRIPE). If your customer has a query or complaint you will deal with them directly. It is only if the buyer escalates the complaint, we at BIMTO will get involved. The seller is liable for ensuring their items are covered by insurance in the case of breakages or non-delivery. See full terms and conditions.
